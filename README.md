# EmotionDetectorMicroBlogs_SMOTE
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Emotions significantly impact human behavior, and extracting insights from social media platforms like Twitter presents unique challenges. By leveraging AI-driven Natural Language Processing, we aim to enhance emotion detection accuracy in user-generated content online. A novel feature representation is introduced and optimized using a Genetic Algorithm to effectively capture users' emotional states. We employ various machine learning classifiers, such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, and XGBoost, to identify emotions from Twitter data. These classifiers are further improved through combinations with Decision Trees, and they undergo optimization techniques like cross-validation and grid search. The culmination of this approach is an ensemble classifier enhanced by Genetic Algorithm techniques, resulting in superior performance.
